        <p>Whiskey Burgers are hamburger patties that are soaked in whiskey and garlic. Once you try them you may never go back to a boring, old, plain burger again!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>(4) 6-6½ oz. hamburger patties</li>
            <li>¼ c. whiskey</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>8 strips of bacon</li>
            <li>8 thick-sliced pieces of cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 large vidalia onions, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>2 T. olive oil</li>
            <li>2 T. reserved bacon fat</li>
            <li>1 t. salt</li>
            <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>Lettuce, tomatoes, or your favorite hamburger fixings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook until crisp. Remove to a paper towel lined plate to cool. Reserve 2 T. of the bacon fat.</li>
            <li>Discard the remaining bacon fat and wipe out the skillet.</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil and the 2 T. of bacon fat to the same skillet, then add the onions, cooking over low heat.</li>
            <li>
                Add the salt and cook, turning the onions often for 30-40 minutes until they are brown and caramelized. Set aside to cool. 
                The onions take a while to cook down and get sweet, about 30-40 minutes over low heat.
                Don’t rush them. Burning or scorching the onions will make them bitter. 
                Take your time and you’ll reap the sweet rewards.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the onions are cooking, add the whiskey and chopped garlic to a shallow dish. ( I use a microplane grater to chop my garlic.) 
                Put in the hamburger patties and let marinate for 15 minutes. 
                Then flip and marinate another 15 on the other side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grill the burgers over medium-high heat for 5 minutes per side for a medium/medium rare burger. 
                If you aren’t using 6 or 6½ oz. hamburgers you might want to cook the hamburgers less if you’re looking for a medium rare burger.
            </li>
            <li>The last minute of grilling, add two slices of cheese to each burger and close the lid to melt the cheese.</li>
            <li>Remove the hamburgers to a platter.</li>
            <li>Place each hamburger on a bottom bun, then top with a large spoonful of caramelized onions and then one or two strips of bacon broken in half.</li>
            <li>Top each burger with the top bun and serve.</li>
        </ol>
