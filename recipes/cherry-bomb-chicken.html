        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart cold water</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken, cut into 4 pieces</li>
            <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 habanero peppers, seeded</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons prepared Thai sweet chili sauce</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, sugar, and kosher salt in a saucepan over low heat; cook until sugar and salt dissolve, 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside until cooled to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Score skin sides chicken pieces 2 to 3 times, about ⅛-inch deep; place in a large bowl or lidded container.</li>
            <li>Combine cherry tomatoes, habanero peppers, garlic, and allspice with sugar and salt mixture in a blender; blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour tomato brine over chicken pieces, making sure all pieces are covered. Cover bowl or container; refrigerate 4 to 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken pieces from brine, shaking off excess; transfer to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Pat chicken pieces dry with paper towels. Discard brine.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high, indirect heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Combine oil, thyme, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl; brush onto chicken pieces</li>
            <li>
                Cook chicken over direct heat, skin sides down, on the preheated grill for 1 to 2 minutes; 
                flip chicken pieces and move to indirect heat. Cook until well-browned and meat is no longer pink in centers, 
                30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near but not touching the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Brush chicken pieces with chili sauce; transfer to a plate and rest before serving for 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
